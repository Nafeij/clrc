[01:17.62][00:51.80][01:43.27]Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
[00:25.95]Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
[00:17.300]Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
[00:34.450]We've been awake all night, shattered dreams all around
[00:42.55]Close your sad, sad eyes we will be safe and sound
[01:00.13]Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
[01:08.84]Daydreaming lightly through the rain, All's forgiven on a summer train
[01:25.69]Seems we are a thousand miles away from last night
[01:34.29]As you sigh in my ear, kiss the rain goodbye
[01:51.79]Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
[02:00.38]Daydreaming lightly through the rain
[02:04.73]All's forgiven on a summer train
[02:09.04]Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
[02:16.56]Come away with me, it's gonna be all right just breathe
[02:25.01]Come away with me, it's gonna be all right you'll see
[02:34.62]And the windows are cryin'  but this train is flyin'  us all through the rain I feel
[02:42.82]And the sky is getting brighter with every mile
[02:47.07]And it all seems clear
[03:00.59]Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
[03:09.16]Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
[03:17.78]Daydreaming lightly through the rain
[03:22.32]All's forgiven on a summer train
[03:26.45]Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
[03:34.32]Come away with me, it's gonna be all right just breathe
[03:42.08]Come away with me, it's gonna be all right you'll see
[03:51.31]Come away with me, it's gonna be all right just breathe
[03:59.39]Come away with me, it's gonna be all right you'll see, you'll see
[04:24.46]Come away with me`;
